Example aac plugin for libshout.
You'll need the WIP/plugins branch from
https://github.com/gquintard/Icecast-libshout that need to be configured with
--enable-plugins (and optionally the PLUGIN_DIR variable)

Configure need two variables :
PLUGIN_DIR: where to install the plugin
SHOUTSRC: a path to libshout source

To use it, instead of shout_set_format, use shout_set_mime with "audio/aac"
for example.


Most of the code here comes from https://github.com/codders/libshout
